# FrensList
FrensList is a basic SwiftUI master-detail list to label and display iPhone or iPad camera roll photos with SwiftData storage.

This project attempts to fulfill the requirements of the Day 77 challenge in Paul Hudson's free [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course. It draws heavily upon the project Stewart Lynch builds in the first two videos of his [PhotoAlbum or Camera](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBn01m5Vbs4DLU9Yiff2V8oyslCdB-pnj&si=xZI4GoDlqiuiqyJr) YouTube playlist. Ridiculous sample data images were generated using ChatGPT+.
